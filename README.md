# AI-Job-Recommendation-System

This project employs Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to construct a job recommendation system based on skill similarity. The model is developed using Python and several popular libraries.

## Features:

Skill analysis of users based on job descriptions.
Calculation of skill similarity to recommend relevant job offers.
Simple user interface via a Flask web application.

## Tools Used:

- **Python:** Primary programming language.
- **Flask:** Web framework for the user interface.
- **BeautifulSoup:** Data extraction from web pages.
- **MongoDB:** Data storage.
- **Spacy:** Natural Language Processing.
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library..
- **JSON:** Data format.
- **Matplotlib:** Data visualization.
  
## Configuration and Installation:

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure Python is installed. Install dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. **Database Configuration:** Set MongoDB connection parameters in the `config.py` file.
3. **Model Training:** Execute the model training script with python `training.py`.
4. **Web Application Launch:** Start the Flask web application with python `app.py`.
